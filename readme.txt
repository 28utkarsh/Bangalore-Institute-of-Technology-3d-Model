This project is about implementing the 3d Model of my college i.e. Bangalore Institute of Technology using OpenGL libraries.

Make sure that your system has GCC complier and OpenGL libraries installed in it. To install OpenGL libraries, refer to following link:

It would be better if your system has Code::Blocks IDE installed in it.

Important Steps 
----------------------------------
1- Please install all OpenGL libraries and setup the environment of C++.
2- Create a folder in desktop named as '3d' and download all the files present in the repository in the same folder.
3- Open main.cpp using your preferred IDE.
4- From line number 34 to 70, change the pathname according to your system. Please note that these are the textures files so that you have to change the path carefully.
5- If you are working in windows then redirect to \bin\Debug\ folder and simply run 3d.exe otherwise download the CodeBlock IDE and open the project and simply execute main.cpp.
